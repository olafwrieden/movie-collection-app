# Movie Database Application
As part of my Computer Science Degree, one of my assignments was to design and build a Java SwingUI app to create, store and filter a series of movies. The scope of this task was restricted in order to introduce SwingUI functionality at a beginner level and teach the MVC architecture.

### The Design Brief
COMING SOON...
* Must be developed using Java in the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org).

## App Overview

#### Main View
The *Main View* is the very first view presented to the user. It shows a collection of films. Below the list, we have the ability to add a movie based on a set of metadata. Off to the right, movies can be filtered based on their attributes. Lastly, a generic search field at the top allows us to quickly search through our collection.

#### Filtering / Searching
We can filter our collection based on criteria.
